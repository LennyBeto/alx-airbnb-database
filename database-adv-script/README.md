ðŸ“Š Advanced SQL Queries & Join Strategies
This document explores fundamental SQL join types, demonstrating their application in retrieving interconnected data within a relational database. Understanding these join strategies is crucial for efficient data retrieval and maintaining data integrity in complex systems like the Airbnb Clone backend.

ðŸ”— Exploring SQL Join Types
We'll examine INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN through practical examples, highlighting their distinct behaviors and ideal use cases.

1. INNER JOIN
Objective: Retrieve all bookings along with the details of the users who made those specific bookings.

Query Example:

SQL

SELECT b.*, u.username, u.email
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id;
Key Notes:

Returns only matched records: This join exclusively returns rows where there is a match in both tables based on the join condition.

Excludes: It will not include users who have no associated bookings, nor will it show any "orphaned" bookings that might not be linked to a valid user.

Real-World Use Case:

Booking History Page: Ideal for displaying a user's actual booking history, ensuring every displayed booking has a valid, existing user tied to it.

2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Objective: Retrieve all properties and any associated reviews, including properties that currently have no reviews.

Query Example:

SQL

SELECT p.id AS property_id, p.name AS property_name, r.id AS review_id, r.rating, r.comment
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.property_id;
Key Notes:

Returns all records from the "left" table: This join returns all rows from the properties table (the "left" table in this case), regardless of whether they have a matching record in the reviews table.

Includes NULL for unmatched records: If a property has no reviews, the columns from the reviews table will show NULL values.

Critical for: Displaying a complete list of properties, ensuring visibility even for newly added properties or those yet to receive feedback.

Real-World Use Case:

Property Listing Page: Essential for showing all available properties to users, providing review details where they exist, and indicating when a property has no reviews yet.

3. FULL OUTER JOIN
Objective: Retrieve all users and all bookings, encompassing scenarios where a user might not have any bookings, or a booking might not be linked to a user.

Query Example:

SQL

-- Note: MySQL does not directly support FULL OUTER JOIN.
-- This is typically achieved by combining LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN with UNION.

-- Example for databases supporting FULL OUTER JOIN (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL Server):
SELECT u.id AS user_id, u.username, b.id AS booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date
FROM users u
FULL OUTER JOIN bookings b ON u.id = b.user_id;

-- Equivalent for MySQL:
SELECT u.id AS user_id, u.username, b.id AS booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON u.id = b.user_id
UNION
SELECT u.id AS user_id, u.username, b.id AS booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date
FROM users u
RIGHT JOIN bookings b ON u.id = b.user_id
WHERE u.id IS NULL; -- Filter out rows already covered by the LEFT JOIN
Key Notes:

Returns all records from both tables: This join includes all rows from both the users and bookings tables.

Includes unmatched records: It will show:

Users who have no bookings (e.g., a host account that has never made a guest booking).

Bookings that are not linked to any existing user (e.g., if a user account was inadvertently deleted without cleaning up associated bookings, indicating a data integrity issue).

Real-World Use Case:

Admin Audit & Data Integrity Checks: Invaluable for database administrators to identify inconsistencies, orphaned records, or users who exist but have no activity, aiding in data cleanup and system health monitoring.
